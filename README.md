# Day 1 – HTML5 + Semantic Layout

##  Objective
To understand the structure of a web page using **semantic HTML5**, without using any CSS or `<div>` elements, and to build a clean, accessible blog layout.

---


##  What I Learned

### 1. Semantic HTML5 Structure
I learned how to structure a webpage using meaningful HTML5 tags instead of generic containers.

Tags used:
- `<header>` – page and article headers
- `<nav>` – navigation menu
- `<main>` – main content of the page
- `<section>` – grouped related content
- `<article>` – independent blog posts
- `<aside>` – sidebar content
- `<footer>` – page and article footers

---

### 2. Page Layout Without CSS
Even without CSS, semantic tags provide a clear and readable layout:
- Header at the top
- Navigation below header
- Main content with articles
- Sidebar for additional content
- Footer at the bottom

This improves **readability and maintainability**.

### 3. Forms & Media
I implemented a form using semantic and accessible HTML:
- `<form>`, `<label>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, `<textarea>`
- Required field validation using `required`

Media elements used:
- `<img>` with proper `alt` text
- `<video>` with `controls` attribute

---

### 4. Accessibility Basics
I learned the importance of accessibility and applied:
- `alt` attributes for images
- `aria-label` for navigation and forms
- Proper label–input associations
- Logical document structure for screen readers

---

### 5. Blog Type Chosen
The blog is a **tutorial / learning blog**, inspired by the “Stand Blog” reference layout.  
Its purpose is to document learning about **HTML5, semantic structure and accessibility**.

##  Outcome
By completing this task, I now have a strong understanding of:
- Semantic HTML5 page structure
- Accessibility-friendly markup
- Writing clean, meaningful HTML without relying on CSS or JavaScript
